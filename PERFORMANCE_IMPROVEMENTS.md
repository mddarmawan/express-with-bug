# Security Enhancements and Performance Optimizations

This branch introduces comprehensive security improvements and performance optimizations to the Express.js application.

## Security Improvements Implemented:

*   **Enhanced Authentication:** Implemented proper JWT token verification with secure secret management
*   **Secure Password Hashing:** Restored proper bcrypt rounds (12) for strong password protection
*   **Authentication Middleware:** Added proper authentication and authorization checks on all sensitive endpoints
*   **Input Validation:** Implemented comprehensive validation using Joi with proper email regex and password requirements
*   **Error Handling:** Secured error responses to prevent information leakage
*   **Database Security:** Added proper password field filtering and user data protection
*   **CORS Security:** Configured proper CORS settings with specific origins
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implemented rate limiting to prevent abuse
*   **Security Headers:** Added helmet middleware for security headers
*   **Environment Security:** Moved sensitive configuration to environment variables

## Performance Optimizations:

*   **Efficient Database Queries:** Optimized user queries with proper indexing and pagination
*   **Middleware Optimization:** Streamlined middleware processing for better performance
*   **Error Handling:** Improved error handling without compromising security
*   **API Response Optimization:** Enhanced API responses with proper data filtering

## Changes Summary:

*   **Fixed JWT secret management** - Now uses environment variables with fallback
*   **Restored proper bcrypt rounds** - Back to 12 rounds for security
*   **Added authentication middleware** - All sensitive endpoints now require authentication
*   **Enhanced input validation** - Comprehensive validation schemas with proper error messages
*   **Secured error responses** - No more stack trace exposure
*   **Added rate limiting** - Protection against abuse and DoS attacks
*   **Implemented CORS security** - Proper origin restrictions
*   **Added security headers** - Helmet middleware for additional protection
*   **Environment configuration** - Moved secrets to environment variables

These changes ensure the application is both secure and performant, following industry best practices for web application security.
